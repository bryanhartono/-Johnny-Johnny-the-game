# -Johnny-Johnny-the-game
A simple RPG puzzle game developed using the allegro library. You will play as Johnny as you try to complete all the puzzles in each level of the game to find Johnny's mother. You will need to download the allegro library in order to run this code.

IDE used is Code::Blocks. Click [allegro-mingw-gcc6.2.0-x86-static-5.2.2.zip](https://github.com/liballeg/allegro5/releases/download/5.2.2.0/allegro-mingw-gcc6.2.0-x86-static-5.2.2.zip) to download the allegro library.

After finish downloading, Un-zip the file and move it to your C drive. The full path should look like: `C:\allegro-mingw-gcc6.2.0-x86-static-5.2.2\allegro`. After that see the [codeblocks allegro setting tutorial](/codeblocks%20allegro%20setting%20tutorial.txt) and modify the project's build settings so that the allegro library can be used.
